# encrypter
An encrypting tool I've made for fun. Do not actually use it for encrypting sensitive data.

The usage is simple; just follow the instructions inside it. Entering a wrong password while decrypting will result in a corrupted file. You can encrypt one file a few times; just be sure to remember all passwords!
